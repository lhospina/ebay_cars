# Exploring eBay Used Car Sales Data

The current project will focus on data scraped from *eBay Kleinanzigen*, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. This dataset is available on Kaggle in a slightly modified version (i.e., the current dataset contains a subsample (50,000) of the original submission).

Aims for this exploration include data cleaning and basic analyses to gather insights regarding the kinds of used cars available for sale and their price points.
